# Interactive Periodic Table

# Abstract

I know that each element of the periodic table has its own fingerprint. I aimed to develop this project, taking into account the software competence in the field of chemistry and technology. This program, which is intended for the use of university, high school students and even every person who knows how to read and write, aims to teach the periodic table, which is the basis of chemistry, in the form of a game to anyone who is interested. This project was developed with javascript based React.js library.
